I took ICS 111 at UH Manoa during the fall semester of 2014. During this time, the course was taught by Jason Leigh. The ICS 111 course taught us the basics of object orienting programming using Java, through the use of Dylan Kobayashi's, a graduate student, multimedia library called <i>EZ Library</i>. As a final project for the course, Jason had us work in teams to create a music video using a previous assignment we made ourselves and the knowledge we gained throughout the semester. As incentive he created a small competition with giving the top 3 teams extra credit and prizes.

For this project we split the work by animating our own sprites throughout the music video. I handled the introduction credits of our team name and member names. I also had to animate the tree and seed. We had weekly meet-ups throughout the second half of the semester to resynchronize our animations and help each other with our bugs and other issues we came across for our part of the project. After all our hard work we ended up taking first place and receiving an "A+" for the project.
